**A Day in the Life of Instruction Fetch**

Modern general purpose high performance processors can execute around ten
instructions each cycle, but can only do so when they know what instructions to
execute. As a result, significant research and engineering is spent ensuring
that the correct instructions are brought to the processor execution units fast
enough. In this talk, we will first review what the modern instruction fetch
hardware looks like, highlighting the considerable progress made since the
5-stage MIPS pipeline. Notably, so-called "datacenter" workloads and their ever
increasing instruction footprint have caused a major shift in organization in
the last decade or so. Then, we will present two techniques that accelerate
instruction delivery in specific scenarios: i) Workloads with high Instruction
Level Parallelism and ii) Workloads with hard to predict conditional branches
(e.g., sorting).

*Arthur Perais has been a CNRS researcher at TIMA in Grenoble since 2020,
working on general purpose microarchitecture techniques often based on
speculation. From 2017 to 2020, he was part of the performance modeling team at
Qualcomm Datacenter Technologies (Raleigh, US) then at Microsoft (Raleigh, US),
working on custom ARM microarchitectures. He obtained his PhD in 2015 from
Université de Rennes 1.*
